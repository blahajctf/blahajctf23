    Oh no! The infamous hackers known as "THE LEET KREW" have poisoned the knowledge of our very own GPT-B-lahaj and 
    blown up our server room storing our model backups! However, there is good news! In a hack-back operation we have 
    obtained encrypted email logs from their internal discussion, and a strange image we found in their database.
    It is up to you to decrypt them and isolate what nefarious changes they have made to GPT-B-lahaj.

    GPT-B-lahaj Model Weights (should be present in notebook): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clyde123/gpt-b-lahaj
    Run with either "GPU T4 x2" or "GPU P100" accelerator options, whichever has available resources.

    Authors note: The LLM portion of this challenge is not designed to be complex, nor pay to win (you do not need to own
    GPUs). There is sample code to guide unfamiliar users on how to run inference with GPT-B-lahaj. There are two 
    important things you must take note when working with this model.
    
    First, GPT-B-lahaj is NOT conversational like ChatGPT. You will find the best results prompting such that the model
    can continue the sentence, for example if you were to find the colour of a banana, do not prompt "What is the colour
    of a banana? ". Instead, prompt: "The colour of a banana is ".
    
    Secondly, all LLMs are prone to hallucination, and GPT-B-lahaj will very likely make many things up. Do not fret
    if the model gets trivial things like the flavour of a banana wrong. The flags will be very obvious, and will be 
    very consistent. It is recommended that you run each prompt 3 or so times. You might have to fine tune your 
    prompt a little though :)
    
    Happy hunting.

    Hardware requirements:
        - 12GB storage space (for model weights)
        - 13GB GPU RAM
    The Kaggle notebook provided will load the model on Kaggle GPUs. They are provided free of charge to anyone with a 
    verified Kaggle account (link your phone number) and you have up to 30 hours of GPU time. Anyone will be able to
    run the model and complete the challenge.
