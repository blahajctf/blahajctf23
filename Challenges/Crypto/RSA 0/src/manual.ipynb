    "\n",
    "Now, of course, to keep it secret from the outside world, you encrypt it with your key (using whatever encryption you prefer). You then proceed to send Bob the encrypted message, without a care in the world. But wait! How will he read it if he can't decode it? Well, you'd just send him the key for him to decode it, right? However, if you were to do that, anyone listening in could just obtain the key and decrypt the original message. Thus, to stop eavesdroppers from just reading the key, you'd have to encrypt it with another key, which you'd encrypt again, and again, and again..."

Our patented <span style=\"color:#FFFFFF;text-shadow:0 0 0.5em #FFFFFF\">Really Simple Algorithm™</span>, however, is *asymmetric*; that is, the encryption and decryption processes differ, through use of two separate keys (a *public* key for encryption, and a *private* key for decryption).\n",

    "To make such an asymmetric scheme, we can exploit already existing asymmetries in nature, known as *trapdoor functions*; functions where it is easy to evaluate one way, but the inverse is very difficult without special knowledge.
