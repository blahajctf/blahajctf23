> our blahajar were collecting intel on some reports of blahaj mistreatment, but all they could get was this image of a cat...

## Solution
dragging away the cat & shark model reveals a 3d model of a flag. In order to obtain the actual file of the flag, however, we can extract the powerpoint file as a .zip, thereby obtaining the original .glb. Opening it in an editor of your choice (e.g. Blender) and looking at the texture of the model reveals the flag.

Flag: `blahaj{blahaj_hate_crime_;(}`
