welcome = '''Welcome to my custom gacha system! Here are the rules.
You are given 5000 turns. In each turn, I will think of a random number, and you will attempt to guess it. Depending on how close you are, you will stand a chance to win one of give attractive prizes!

If our numbers are the same for 50 consecutive turns, you win a 1-star chainhaj.
If our numbers are the same for 100 consecutive turns, you win a 2-star smolhaj.
If our numbers are the same for 200 consecutive turns, you win a 3-star blahaj.
If our numbers are the same for 300 consecutive turns, you win a 4-star bighaj.
And finally, if our numbers are the same for 500 consecutive turns, you win the grand prize, the 5-star SSR flag!
Note that you cannot win the same prize twice.

Have fun!
